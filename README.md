I am a problem-solver looking to break into the field of Tech. I am currently a GA SEI Student graduating in February 2023 where Iâ€™m learning team collaboration strategies to work on software development. For the past 6 years, I have worked in human resources and recruiting where I developed interpersonal, problem-solving, and communication skills. In the future, I see myself in an organization that values autonomy and innovation, and which would help me develop my creative and problem-solving skills and offer more opportunites for growth.
